# veterinarian_clinic
This is the final project for the backend bootcamp from Promineo tech
This project was written by Christen Oorlog and myself.
We split up the entities and wrote the controller, service, and dao layers for each of our entities.
The appointment_services layer does not have a controller, service, or dao layer
